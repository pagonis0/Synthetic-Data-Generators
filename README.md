## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of synthetic data generation techniques and their application in Knowledge Tracing (KT) models as discussed in our paper: [Analysis of Knowledge Tracing Performance on Synthesized Student Data](https://doi.org/10.34657/13456).

## Project Description

Knowledge Tracing (KT) models aim to predict the future performance of students by tracking the development of their knowledge states. Due to limitations in access to real-life data and the presence of noise and diversity issues in public datasets, this project explores the use of synthetic data to enhance KT models. We utilize three statistical strategies to generate synthetic data and test their effectiveness on two KT baseline models.


## Results

The results of our experiments show that synthetic data can achieve performance close to real data in KT models. However, the improvement in model performance with additional synthetic data is minimal, indicating that simply augmenting real data with synthetic data may not be sufficient for significant gains. Detailed results and analysis are provided in the `results/` directory.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using synthetic data in educational data mining and knowledge tracing. Future work could focus on improving the data generation methods and exploring other applications within intelligent tutoring systems.
